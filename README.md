# who-life-ex

A group assignment completed as part of the Predictive Modelling module at Digital Futures Academy.   

The aim of the project was to create two models for predicting life expectancy. One robust comprehensive model with as many features as possible, and another model with as few features as possible whilst consideration is given to ethics and bias.

We were a team of 4, my main task was Exploratory Data Analysis.

For this project we used Python, specifically scikit-learn and statsmodels libraries.
